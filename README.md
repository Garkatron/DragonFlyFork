# DragonFly BTA Model Library

### Currently Available Features
- ModelHelper, Helper class for creating block and entity models
- Supports a limited version of Modern MC Models
- Supports a limited version of Modern Bedrock edition entity Models

This is an early pre release version of DragonFly, expect many bugs, and expect many features to get broken in future updates
